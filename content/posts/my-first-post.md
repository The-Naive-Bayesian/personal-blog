I'm Chris Emerson, and welcome to my shiny new blog.

Like a lot of people, I've tried blogging in the past but never
quite stuck with it. I'm a web developer (among other things),
and up until recently I've been pretty narrowly focused on my
career and didn't want to spend the time to write things for the
world, partly because I didn't think I had much to say that wasn't
already being said better.

After some frustrating experiences in a recent job hunt, I started
to reconsider writing online. I got into web development from a
nontraditional route (philosophy BA -> actuarial consultant ->
math BS -> QA engineer -> data analyst -> web developer) without
much formal training in programming, and I'm now starting to
focus intensely on improving my technical skills outside of work.
Perhaps my experience and journey can help other people! ...and
if not, I'd still like to put my voice out there anyway :P

In any case, however you found yourself here, welcome! I'd say
there's plenty more to come, but I've said that before on blogs
I never posted on again, so instead I'll just say: hello, world!
