## The Plan
My plan for this blog is to focus on two main things: (1) me learning and
using [Go](https://golang.org/), and me learning and practicing algorithms
and data structures.

Basically, it's intended to be a professional blog, though I reserve the right
to go totally off-topic.

My professional background is all over the place. My first 'career'-type job
was as an actuarial consultant for health insurance, and since then I've
been a QA automation engineer, managed a team of QA engineers, built predictive
models, and done front- and back-end development.

After all of that I've finally figured out that I most enjoy backend development
plus some machine learning stuff (it only took me nearly 10 years of my
working life!).

## Why study algorithms?
Unfortunately, while having broad experience in different roles and industries
is helpful _on the job_, it is often not as helpful in _getting a job_. After
a few frustrating interviews for backend jobs I decided that I was
long overdue to really sit down, narrow my focus, and learn the absolute
**shit** out of core comp-sci concepts while becoming a legit expert in a
specific backend language.

## Why Go?
I decided to focus on learning Go because I legitimately enjoy using the
language, and it seems to be growing fast with a lot of applications in
web development. Also it has a really friendly community!

Don't get me wrong - I think a lot of languages out there are great in similar
ways! That said, I had to pick one, and Go strikes me as one where I can learn
a lot from its design and have practical applications (and jobs) when I get
solid.

## So What's Next?
I'm not sure on the specifics, but I expect to start cross-posting articles 
here and on [Medium](https://medium.com/) and the
[Dev Community](https://dev.to/). I'll also have some more personal/less
technical and shorter posts on here, so it won't all be the same everywhere.

I'm looking forward to this! I've always found it hard to focus on one thing
for long - there are too many interesting things out there! - but I've been
in development long enough to know I want to be in this long-term. The
investment of time and focus is worth it, and I want to see what I can do
when I put all my energy into one thing.

We'll see.
